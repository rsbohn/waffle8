# Phase 1 Implementation Complete: Hardware Interrupt Support

## Summary

Successfully implemented full interrupt support for the PDP-8 emulator with a single hardware interrupt line model and software-based device polling via skip chains. All 11 implementation tasks are complete.

## What Was Implemented

### Core CPU Changes (main.c)
- ✅ Added `interrupt_enable` (bool) and `interrupt_pending` (int) fields to struct pdp8
- ✅ Implemented ION/IOFF instruction decoding in operate_group2()
- ✅ Added interrupt dispatch logic in pdp8_api_step() that:
  - Saves AC/PC/LINK context to addresses 0x0006-0x0008
  - Decrements pending counter
  - Disables interrupts
  - Jumps to ISR at 0x0010

### Public API (pdp8.h + main.c implementations)
```c
int pdp8_api_request_interrupt(pdp8_t *cpu, uint8_t device_code);
int pdp8_api_peek_interrupt_pending(const pdp8_t *cpu);
int pdp8_api_clear_interrupt_pending(pdp8_t *cpu);
```

### Watchdog Device Integration
- ✅ Added interrupt commands: WD_CMD_INTERRUPT_ONE_SHOT=5, WD_CMD_INTERRUPT_PERIODIC=6
- ✅ Updated watchdog expiry handler to call pdp8_api_request_interrupt() for these modes
- ✅ Monitor config parsing supports watchdog.mode="interrupt"

### Testing
- ✅ 3 C unit tests in tests/test_emulator.c:
  - test_ion_ioff: ION/IOFF instruction execution
  - test_interrupt_pending_count: Interrupt queue management
  - test_interrupt_dispatch: Context save and dispatch to ISR

- ✅ 2 Python integration tests in factory/test_watchdog.py:
  - test_interrupt_one_shot: Watchdog generates single interrupt
  - test_interrupt_periodic: Watchdog generates repeated interrupts

- ✅ All 13 C tests pass
- ✅ All Python watchdog tests pass

### Documentation
- ✅ Comprehensive docstrings in pdp8.h explaining interrupt model
- ✅ Example ISR pattern showing device polling with ISK
- ✅ Context save layout documented
- ✅ Updated AGENTS.md with interrupt support conventions

### Example Assembly Code
- ✅ demo/interrupt-test.asm showing:
  - ISR entry at 0x0010
  - Device polling with ISK instructions
  - Context restore and return pattern
  - Multiple device handling via skip chains

## Architecture Decisions

### Single Interrupt Line (Not Per-Device Queue)
**Rationale**: Authentic to real PDP-8 hardware, which had one physical interrupt line. Multiple devices asserted it; software polled to determine which ones needed service.

**Benefits**:
- Simpler implementation (counter instead of queue)
- Flexible device polling order (ISR controls)
- No queue overflow risk
- Matches how real PDP-8 software actually worked

### Software Device Polling via ISK
Each device has an ISK (Interrupt Skip If flag) instruction that software calls to determine if service is needed:
```asm
ISK 6551        / Check watchdog (device 55)
JMP NEXT        / Not ready
JMS HANDLE_WD   / Handle it
```

This requires devices to maintain flags internally, but gives the ISR complete flexibility.

### Single Trap Vector (0x0010)
All interrupts use vector 0x0010. Dispatch is simple: save context, jump to ISR. The ISR determines device identity via skip chain polling, not via trap vector.

## Usage Pattern

1. **Device signals interrupt**:
   ```c
   pdp8_api_request_interrupt(cpu, device_code);
   // interrupt_pending++ internally
   ```

2. **CPU executes and detects pending interrupt** (in pdp8_api_step):
   ```c
   if (interrupt_enable && interrupt_pending > 0) {
       save_context();
       interrupt_pending--;
       interrupt_enable = false;
       pc = 0x0010;  // Jump to ISR
   }
   ```

3. **ISR polls devices and services them**:
   ```asm
   ISK 6551        / Check watchdog
   JMP DONE
   JMS HANDLE_WD   / Service it
   
   DONE:
       ION         / Re-enable interrupts
       JMP I 0x0007 / Return to interrupted program
   ```

## Testing Results

```
All 13 tests passed:
✅ memory reference
✅ indirect
✅ operate group 1
✅ operate group 2
✅ iot
✅ magtape sense
✅ clear halt
✅ kl8e console
✅ line printer
✅ fruit jam board
✅ ion ioff
✅ interrupt pending count
✅ interrupt dispatch
```

```
Python watchdog tests:
✅ read/write roundtrip
✅ one-shot HALT
✅ one-shot RESET
✅ one-shot INTERRUPT
✅ periodic INTERRUPT
```

## Implementation Metrics

- **Total lines of code added**: ~240 lines (including tests/docs)
- **Total lines of code modified**: ~30 lines
- **Files touched**: 9
- **Time to implement**: Single focused session
- **Code review complexity**: Low (simple counter-based model)

## Next Steps (Optional Future Work)

1. **Additional device interrupt modes**: Currently only watchdog has interrupt support. Other devices (keyboard, printer, magtape) could be updated similarly.

2. **ISK instruction emulation**: Currently ISK is implicitly handled by device IOT handlers. Could add explicit ISK operation handling if needed.

3. **Priority-based interrupts**: The current model treats all interrupts equally. Could add priority levels via interrupt code if desired.

4. **Performance monitoring**: Could track interrupt latency, frequency, etc. for profiling.

5. **Better error handling**: Currently treats interrupt_pending as unsigned with no bounds checking. Could add limits if needed.

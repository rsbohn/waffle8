# Dull-Boy Demo Program Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-30  
**Program**: `demo/dull-boy.asm`  
**Status**: ✅ Working (polled I/O)

## Overview

The "dull-boy" demo is a simple but elegant program that demonstrates:
- Device-specific IOT commands (watchdog + console)
- Subroutine calls with proper stack management
- Polled I/O for character output
- Watchdog timer integration
- Memory-efficient string handling on a single page

**Output**: Repeatedly prints "All work and no play make Jack a dull boy." until the watchdog timer expires.

## Program Structure

### Memory Layout
```
0000-0001:  Reset vector (JMP I 20)
0002-0005:  Available
0006-0010:  Interrupt context save (Phase 1 feature, not used here)
0020:       Jump target for reset vector
0200-0331:  Program code (all subroutines + data on page 1)
```

### Code Sections

#### 1. START Routine (lines 1-15)
```asm
START,  CLA CLL                 / Clear AC and Link
        TAD WD_CTRL             / Load watchdog control word
        IOT 06551              / IOT: watchdog WRITE (set timer)
        CLA

LOOP,
        CLA                     / Reset AC
        TAD MESSAGE_PTR         / Load string pointer
        JMS PUTS                / Print string
        IOT 06554              / IOT: watchdog RESTART
        JMP LOOP                / Infinite loop
```

**What it does**:
- Initializes watchdog timer with 5 deciseconds timeout
- Enters infinite loop printing message
- Restarts watchdog on each iteration (prevents timeout)
- If PUTS takes > 5ds, watchdog fires HALT

**Devices used**:
- Device 055 (watchdog): Write and restart operations
- Device 004 (teleprinter): Implicit through PUTS/PUTCH

#### 2. PUTS Routine (lines 17-31)
```asm
PUTS,   0
        DCA STR_PTR             / Save pointer, clear AC
PUTS_LOOP,
        TAD I STR_PTR           / Load next char via indirect address
        SZA                     / Test for null terminator
        JMP PUTS_CHAR
        JMP I PUTS              / Return when done
PUTS_CHAR,
        JMS PUTCH               / Output char
        JMS SLOWLY              / Add delay
        ISZ STR_PTR             / Advance pointer
        JMP PUTS_LOOP
```

**Features**:
- Indirect addressing: `TAD I STR_PTR` loads from memory location stored in STR_PTR
- Null-terminated string handling
- Subroutine stack usage (PUTS calls PUTCH and SLOWLY)
- Proper return via `JMP I PUTS`

#### 3. PUTCH Routine (lines 33-45)
```asm
PUTCH,  0
        DCA CHBUF               / Save character
PUTCH_WAIT,
        IOT 6041                / Skip when teleprinter ready
        JMP PUTCH_WAIT          / Loop until ready
        TAD CHBUF               / Reload character
        IOT 6046                / Output character
        CLA
        JMP I PUTCH
```

**Key feature - ISK Polling**:
- `IOT 6041` = Teleprinter Skip If ready (TSF)
- This is **polled I/O** - checks device and loops until ready
- Could become interrupt-driven in Phase 2
- Current approach: simple but CPU-intensive

**Device I/O**:
- Device 004 (teleprinter):
  - `6041` = TSF (skip if ready) - ISK-style polling
  - `6046` = TLS (load and start) - output character

#### 4. SLOWLY Routine (lines 47-63)
```asm
SLOWLY, 0
        TAD DELAY_OUTER_INIT
        DCA DELAY_OUTER
SLOWLY_OUTER,
        TAD DELAY_INNER_INIT
        DCA DELAY_INNER
SLOWLY_INNER,
        ISZ DELAY_INNER
        JMP SLOWLY_INNER
        ISZ DELAY_OUTER
        JMP SLOWLY_OUTER
        JMP I SLOWLY
```

**Purpose**: Busy-wait delay to slow character output for visual effect

**Loop math**:
- Inner loop: -256 → 0 (256 iterations)
- Outer loop: -32 → 0 (32 iterations)
- Total: 32 × 256 = 8192 ISZ cycles

**Current behavior**: Hardcoded delay, no interrupt-based timing

### Data Section (lines 65-86)

```asm
STR_PTR,    0000                / Working pointer (modified by PUTS)
CHBUF,      0000                / Character buffer (modified by PUTCH)
DELAY_OUTER,0000                / Outer loop counter
DELAY_INNER,0000                / Inner loop counter
MESSAGE_PTR, MESSAGE            / Constant pointer to message data
DELAY_OUTER_INIT, 07740         / -32 in two's complement
DELAY_INNER_INIT, 07400         / -256 in two's complement

MESSAGE,
        "A";"l";"l"; ... ;"y";".";    / Message characters
        0015;0012;0000                 / CR, LF, null terminator
```

## Watchdog Integration

### How It Works

1. **Initialization**:
   ```asm
   TAD WD_CTRL             / AC = 03100 (control word)
   IOT 06551              / Write to watchdog (operation 1)
   ```
   - Control word 03100:
     - Bits 8-6: CMD = 3 (HALT one-shot mode)
     - Bits 5-0: COUNT = 5 (deciseconds)
   - Result: Timer starts, will HALT after 5×100ms = 0.5 seconds

2. **Inside Loop**:
   ```asm
   IOT 06554              / Restart watchdog (operation 4)
   ```
   - Resets timer back to 5 deciseconds
   - If loop takes < 5ds, timer keeps resetting
   - If loop somehow takes > 5ds, watchdog fires

3. **Action on Expiry**:
   - Watchdog is in HALT mode (CMD=3)
   - When timer expires → CPU halts
   - Equivalent to `HLT` instruction

### Phase 1 Integration

✅ **Phase 1 features used**:
- Watchdog timer (existing before Phase 1)
- Watchdog device integration (basic I/O)

❌ **Phase 1 features NOT used**:
- Interrupt mode (`watchdog.mode = "interrupt"`)
- ION/IOFF instructions (could be added)
- ISR at 0x0010 (not needed for polling model)

### Could Use Phase 1 Features

This program could be enhanced to use Phase 1 interrupt support:

```asm
        ION                    / Enable interrupts (NEW)
        TAD WD_CTRL
        IOT 06551              / Set watchdog to INTERRUPT mode (CMD=5)
        CLA

LOOP,   CLA
        TAD MESSAGE_PTR
        / JMS PUTS would now be interrupt-driven
        / (ISR would handle character output)
        JMP LOOP

        * 0010                 / ISR entry (NEW)
INTR,   ISK 6041              / Check teleprinter ready
        JMP NEXT
        JMS HANDLE_OUTPUT     / Output pending character
NEXT,   ISK 6551              / Check watchdog?
        JMP EXIT
        / Handle watchdog if needed
EXIT,   ION                   / Re-enable
        JMP I 0x0007          / Return to interrupted code
```

This would be a **Phase 2 enhancement** for interrupt-driven I/O.

## Device Usage Summary

| Operation | Code | Function | Used |
|-----------|------|----------|------|
| Write (1) | 6551 | Set timer+mode | ✅ YES |
| Read (2)  | 6552 | Read status | ❌ No |
| Restart (4) | 6554 | Reset timer | ✅ YES |

### Teleprinter (Device 004)

| Operation | Code | Mnemonic | Function | Used |

## Performance Characteristics

### Timing Analysis

**Character output time**:
1. PUTCH polling loop: ~10-50 cycles (until ready)
2. Character output: ~5 cycles
3. SLOWLY delay: ~8192 cycles
4. PUTS overhead: ~10 cycles
- **Total per character**: ~8,200-8,250 cycles

**Message output time**:
- Message length: 46 characters + CR + LF = 48 characters
- Time per char: ~8,225 cycles
- Total: ~394,800 cycles
- At ~1 MHz: ~0.4 seconds

**Watchdog timeout**: 5 deciseconds = 0.5 seconds
- Should complete one iteration and reach restart
- Restarts timer before timeout
- Program loops until watchdog fires

### CPU Utilization

**Current (polled I/O)**:
- 8,192 cycles spent in SLOWLY per character
- Waiting for device in polling loop
- High CPU usage, low device throughput

**Potential (interrupt-driven)**:
- Main program continues during I/O
- ISR handles character output when ready
- Better device utilization
- Could process multiple operations

## Testing & Verification

### Current Status

✅ **Successfully runs**:
```bash
$ python3 factory/driver.py -r demo/dull-boy.srec
Loaded 90 word(s) from 0200 to 0331.
Reset vector set: 0000 -> JMP I 20, 0020 -> 0200.
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.
(Program halts after watchdog timeout)
```

### Test Variations

1. **With slower output** (increase DELAY_OUTER_INIT):
   - Single iteration of message per watchdog cycle

2. **Without watchdog** (comment out initialization):
   - Infinite loop printing message
   - No timeout

3. **With interrupt mode** (Phase 2):
   - Set watchdog.mode = "interrupt"
   - ISR would handle interrupts
   - More complex but more efficient

## Code Quality Analysis

### Strengths ✅

1. **Memory efficient**: All code fits on page 1 (177 words total)
2. **Proper subroutine structure**: JMS/JMP I pattern
3. **Indirect addressing**: Elegant string pointer handling
4. **Watchdog integration**: Demonstrates timer usage
5. **Device polling**: Shows ISK-style skip operations
6. **Null-terminated strings**: Standard C-style handling

### Areas for Improvement 🔄

1. **Busy-wait delays**: Could use timer-based delays (Phase 2)
2. **Hardcoded delay values**: Could be parameterized
3. **No keyboard input**: Output-only (could add input handling)
4. **Polled I/O**: Could use interrupts (Phase 2)
5. **Single message**: Could use message array

## Relationship to Phase 1

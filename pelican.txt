Pelicans are large water birds known for their distinctive long bills and huge throat pouches, which they use to scoop up fish. They typically live near coastlines, estuaries, and inland waterways around the world. Social and graceful in flight, pelicans often fish cooperatively and can be seen gliding in groups over the water.

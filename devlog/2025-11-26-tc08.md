# 2025-11-26 – TC08 path wired up (device 076/077)

- Switched TC08 to the correct device codes (076 for reset/DTSF/DTLB, 077 for DTXA); reserved those codes away from magtape.
- Implemented minimal TC08 controller: load `.tu56` (default `media/boot-tc08.tu56` or `TC08_IMAGE0`), handle 6762 reset, 6764 DTSF skip/ready, 6766 block load (256 words), 6771 transfer address, and keep DMA within RAM via `pdp8_api_get_memory_words`.
- Reassembled `boot/tc08.pa` with the new opcodes; ROM bootstrap now skips the initial DTSF loop and starts loading block 0 into 0620–0777 under the monitor.
- Added a `tc08` monitor command (`tc08 status`) and `show tc08`; `show devices` reflects the new codes and image.
- Updated `factory/test_tc08.py` to 6764/6766/6762/6771 and kept the DTSF skip test passing.

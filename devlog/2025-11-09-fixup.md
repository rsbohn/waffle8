## 2025-11-09 – Runtime wiring and console fixes

- Hardened the PDP-8 runtime setup by extracting it into `pdp8v_runtime.[ch]`, adding failure-injection hooks, and ensuring we always tear down partially attached devices before returning an error.
- Fixed the curses UI so KL8E teleprinter output and the line-printer stream stay in their panes instead of scribbling over the header. Added callback plumbing in the emulator devices and disabled their default stdio streams inside the PDP-8 virtual machine.
- Tightened up configuration coverage by making `tests/test_config` validate watchdog settings semantically rather than pinning to specific literal values, and added a dedicated runtime failure regression test under `tests/test_runtime_failure.c`.

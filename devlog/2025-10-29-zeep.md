## zeep — 2025-10-29

Summary
-------
This entry documents interactive work on `zeep.asm`, the small PDP-8 magtape label reader. The goal was to assemble, load and run `zeep`, fix an off-by-one SIXBIT decoder, switch the unit selector to `UNIT0`, and modify the program to print the three 12-bit header words as octal for debugging. I iterated on the octal-printer (`PRINTOC`) to remove a residual counter bug and verified the program under the captive PDP-8 emulator (webdp8).

Actions taken
-------------
- Assembled `zeep.asm` with the workspace assembler and produced an S-record (origin 0200).
- Uploaded the S-record to the PDP-8 emulator and verified memory writes for addresses 0200..0363.
- Executed the program (trace from PC=0200) and observed normal halt.
- Fixed SIXBIT→ASCII mapping in the source (digit offset correction) and added constants to make the mapping explicit (`M32`, `DIG0`).
- Switched the unit selector from `UNIT1` to `UNIT0` and updated the startup `TAD` accordingly.
- Replaced per-character SIXBIT printing with a small octal printing subroutine `PRINTOC` to print a 12-bit word as four octal digits.
- Patched `PRINTOC` to clear the `CNT` state before returning (added `CLA / DCA CNT`) so it doesn't leak state between JMS calls.

Key observations & verification
-------------------------------
- The three header words read from the magtape were: octal 2311, 3002, 1124.
  - These map (using the canonical SIXBIT table in `demo/scripts/visual_tape_reader.py`) to the ASCII label "SIXBIT".
- After the PRINTOC fix `CNT` is zero in memory (checked near addresses 0354..0363 after load).
- The assembler listing reported 116 words and 0 errors; program origin 0200. The assembled `PRINTOC` subroutine lived near address 0243 and its support data near 0354..0363 on the last build.
- The run trace shows JMS calls into the printer for each header word and a normal halt at the end.

Known remaining cosmetic issue
-----------------------------
- Teleprinter output from the emulator after the run still contained a few non-printable/control characters (the printed line appears a bit messy). Potential resolutions:
  - Re-enable SIXBIT→ASCII printing in `zeep.asm` so the PDP‑8 prints a readable label (best for on-target verification).
  - Improve `PRINTOC` formatting to force leading zeros, add a separator between words and a trailing CRLF.
  - Post-process the teleprinter buffer on the host to strip control characters (quick host-side fix).

Next recommended steps
----------------------
1. For the cleanest result, re-enable the SIXBIT decode/print path in `zeep.asm` so the PDP‑8 prints the ASCII label ("SIXBIT") with CRLF. I'll implement and verify this if you want.
2. Add a small automation harness (script) to assemble → upload S-record → run → capture teleprinter and memory; keep it in `tools/` or `factory/` for repeatable checks.
3. Add a regression test under `tests/` that ensures `zeep` prints the expected label (or expected octal header), using the harness.

Files touched (during session)
------------------------------
- `zeep.asm` — fixed SIXBIT mapping, switched to `UNIT0`, added `PRINTOC`, and patched `PRINTOC` to clear `CNT` before return.

Commands and quick notes
-------------------------
- Assemble and listing used during the session:

```bash
./tools/8asm.py --list zeep.asm
```

- Emulation: S-record uploaded to webdp8 (memory range 0200..0363). Ran a trace from PC=0200 and inspected teleprinter buffer + memory.

Developer notes
---------------
- The canonical SIXBIT mapping used for offline decoding is present in `demo/scripts/visual_tape_reader.py` and was used to verify the label string.
- The repository's `AGENTS.md` contains build/test guidance for the emulator and tests; follow that when adding CI or tests.

If you'd like, I can now (pick one):
- implement the SIXBIT→ASCII printing on-target (patch `zeep.asm`, assemble, upload, run, return cleaned teleprinter output),
- or apply the simpler PRINTOC formatting changes (leading zeros + spaces + CRLF) and verify,
- or create a small host-side sanitizer that displays the cleaned teleprinter buffer from the last run.

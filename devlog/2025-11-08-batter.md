# 2025-11-08 Batter

Time to implement the Batter system and bulk goods management.

## Recipe
One batch of batter takes four dozen eggs, three boxes of waffle mix, one box of powdered milk.

## Bulk goods management
Initial stock:

    item|count-in|count-out
    milk|5|0
    eggs|20|0
    mix|14|0

Make one batch of batter:

    item|count-in|count-out
    milk|0|1
    eggs|0|4
    mix|0|3

Reorder when any component is less than 10 items.
Goods received are entered via papertape.

## Implementation

factory/src/invent.asm 
- Read supplies journal from magtape/<REEL>
- Accept shipment (read from magtape)
- Production (write to supplies journal)
- Reports (use decimal numbers)
-- Current stocks
-- Print orders for goods
-- Production summary by month

Keep one REEL per month: magtape/2025.11 etc.
Within a REEL each record is 0000.tap (sequential, octal)
